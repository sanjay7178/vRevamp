    <h1>vRevamp Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <p>vRevamp is not affiliated with any college or external organisation. This is a student-run developers' and content creators' community focusing on delivering guidance to students with help of the input from various fellow student's experiences. At Null Chapter we develop web and mobile applications that help other students to navigate through their college life in a much smoother manner. vRevamp is not an official entity that falls under the management of VIT and hence the data produced here isn't official and is just a personal opinion shared by various individuals of the same college.</p>
